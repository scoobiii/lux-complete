Abstract: More than 50% of all energy inputs in thermal-based energy matrices—spanning biomass, uranium, and hydrocarbons—are lost during conversion, with efficiency below 50%. Despite vast investments and technological advancements, global power generation and mobility systems remain profoundly inefficient. Simultaneously, the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector, the fastest-growing over the past 50 years, consumes 3% of total global energy while exhibiting conversion efficiencies inferior to nuclear power plants (~34%). These systemic inefficiencies not only squander an estimated US$17 trillion annually but also significantly exacerbate artificial contributions to global warming, intensifying natural climatic oscillations into anthropogenic chaos. This paper calls for a systemic transformation in energy production and consumption models.

Introduction: The global energy system is characterized by entrenched inefficiencies that remain hidden beneath the veneer of progress. Predominantly thermal in nature, the energy matrix continues to rely on combustion processes—burning fossil fuels, biomass, and splitting uranium atoms—to generate electricity and power mobility. As illustrated by the International Energy Agency’s Sankey diagrams (see Figure 1), more than half of the primary energy input is lost as heat, underscoring a systemic inefficiency that persists despite technological innovation.

Results and Observations: Recent global energy flow analysis reveals:

Over 50% of energy inputs in thermal systems are lost as heat (Figure 1).

ICT infrastructure and data centers now consume approximately 3% of global electricity, growing exponentially.

The average energy efficiency of ICT is below 34%, trailing even nuclear thermal efficiency standards.

Combined, these inefficiencies translate into financial losses of approximately US$17 trillion per year globally.

According to a 2024 MIT report, the energy consumed by ChatGPT alone can rival that of a small city (source).


Discussion: The inefficiency of thermal systems is a fundamental limitation imposed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Yet, the scale of waste in modern systems far exceeds theoretical limits, indicating systemic mismanagement and outdated infrastructure. ICT’s rapid growth compounds the crisis, as even the most advanced servers and cooling systems cannot offset their increasing consumption and poor energy conversion. The climate implications are severe: these inefficiencies drive up fossil fuel demand, amplify greenhouse gas emissions, and distort natural climate rhythms into artificial crises.

Conclusion: This analysis highlights the urgent need to transition toward a regenerative, high-efficiency energy paradigm centered on electrification, renewables, and circular design. Innovations in energy storage, decentralized grids, and AI-optimized distribution are not optional—they are imperative. Failing to address systemic inefficiencies will further entrench economic and climatic instability on a planetary scale.
