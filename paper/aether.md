Lux Complete: Aether: A Novel Non-Binary Optical Computing Architecture and Programming Ecosystem

Abstract

Modern computing architectures face limitations in energy efficiency and computational density. This paper introduces Lux Complete, a novel computational paradigm leveraging non-binary optical computing. A dedicated programming language, Aether, along with a foundational runtime environment, Lumina, are presented. The paper contrasts this new stack with traditional Turing-complete architectures, highlighting the potential for enhanced performance and energy efficiency derived from native support for massive parallelism and direct manipulation of photonic properties. A detailed roadmap towards the development of Lux Complete, with a focus on compilation techniques, runtime environment implementation, and benchmark comparisons, is presented.

1. Introduction

The relentless pursuit of enhanced computational power has driven advancements across diverse paradigms, from silicon-based processors to quantum computing. However, inherent limitations in the scaling of transistor density and the excessive energy demands of conventional architectures necessitate the exploration of alternative computing models [1]. Similarly, while quantum computing offers a promising avenue for solving classically intractable problems, its practical realization remains hindered by challenges in qubit stability and the cryogenic requirements for qubit coherence [2].

Optical computing, leveraging photons instead of electrons, presents a compelling alternative, eliminating the limitations associated with electrical resistance and heat dissipation [3]. Furthermore, the ability to modulate multiple photonic properties (frequency, phase, polarization) allows for non-binary data representation, potentially leading to increased computational density and efficiency. This paper introduces the Lux Complete architecture, a novel non-binary optical computing paradigm coupled with a dedicated programming ecosystem, Aether/Lumina, designed to unlock the full potential of photonic computation.

2. Architectural Principles of Lux Complete

Lux Complete is predicated on the following key principles:

Non-Binary Optical Computing: The fundamental unit of computation is the photon, manipulated through precise control of its properties (frequency, phase, polarization) to represent and process information beyond the binary domain.

Photonic Interconnect Fabrics: Data and control signals are transmitted via highly reflective optical fibers, minimizing energy loss and enabling high-bandwidth communication.

Solar-Powered Operation: The architecture is designed to be powered by integrated solar energy capture, with excess photonic energy dynamically routed to regions of high demand or low solar availability.

3. Aether: A Domain-Specific Language for Photonic Computation

To effectively harness the unique capabilities of Lux Complete, a new programming language, Aether, is introduced. Aether is designed with the following core features:

Native Photonic Data Types: Built-in data types to represent photons and their properties, enabling intuitive manipulation of photonic states.

Implicit Parallelism: The language structure promotes automatic parallelization by the Lumina runtime, simplifying the development of highly concurrent applications.

Formal Verification: Integration with formal methods (e.g., Lean4) allows for rigorous verification of program correctness, crucial for reliable photonic computation.

The core primitive operations must be focused on managing ligth:

Operações com Photon:

MODULATE(photon, frequencia, fase, polarizacao): Modifica as propriedades de um fóton.
TRANSMIT(photon, canal): Envia o fóton por um canal.
RECEIVE(canal) -> Photon: Recebe o fóton.
SPLIT(photon, razão): Divide um fóton em múltiplos com intensidade reduzida.
INTERFERE(photon1, photon2): Causa interferência quântica entre os fótons
Superposição, etc

This is not Turing complete code.

4. Lumina: The Lux Complete Runtime Environment

Lumina serves as the foundational runtime for Lux Complete, responsible for executing Aether programs on emulated or, in the future, physical optical hardware. Its key responsibilities include:

Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL): Provides a uniform interface to underlying optical components, allowing Aether programs to be hardware-agnostic.

Resource Management: Dynamically allocates photonic resources (wavelengths, polarization channels) and manages energy flow within the system.

Formal Verification Integration: Interfaces with formal verification tools to ensure code correctness.

To ensure the correctness of the whole model, see the unit test implementation for each module.

The AST implementation must have the following instructions for execute this model.
For that the following actions must be executed:

Update / src/ast.rs with a value.

Implement the following:

and update the code for.

test_ola_lux() -> Result<(), String>

//Testa um Hello wolrd

let source = r#"fn main() { print("Olá, Lux!"); return 0; }"#;
compile_and_run(source)

Evaluation and Benchmarking

To quantify the advantages of the Lux Complete architecture and the Aether/Lumina ecosystem, a series of benchmarks are proposed:

Microbenchmarks: Measure the performance of fundamental operations (addition, multiplication, logical operations) on photonic data types compared to equivalent operations on traditional CPU architectures.

Application Benchmarks: Implement and compare the performance of Lux Complete and CPU-based implementations of key algorithms, such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and neural network inference.

Energy Efficiency Analysis: Measure and compare the energy consumption of Lux Complete and CPU-based systems for a range of computational tasks.

These data will be avaliable on README.md

The benchmarks will be tested and reported to the repository with the correct information.

This step concludes the inicial step.
